# Business Alert System

## About

This project was initially developed during a 4 day hack-a-thon event during my time as a student at The Fullstack Academy of Code. The Business Alert System platform allows a business owner (the user) to create, update, and delete clients from their contact list as well alert individual clients, or the entire contact list, of important announcements via text message.
